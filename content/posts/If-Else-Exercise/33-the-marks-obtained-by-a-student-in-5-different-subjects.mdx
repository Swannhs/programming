title: The marks obtained by a student in 5 different subjects are input through the keyboard. The student gets a division as per the following rules: −Percentage above or equal to 60 – First division −Percentage between 50 and 59 – Second division −Percentage between 40 and 49 – Third division −Percentage less than 40 – Fail

## C Implementation
### Program-33: The marks obtained by a student in 5 different subjects are input through the keyboard. The student gets a division as per the following rules: −Percentage above or equal to 60 – First division
### Percentage between 50 and 59 – Second division
### Percentage between 40 and 49
### Third division −Percentage less than 40 – Fail
```c
#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
    int a,b,c,d,e,s;
    printf("Enter the number of 5 different subjects of a student-");
    scanf("%d%d%d%d%d",&a,&b,&c,&d,&e);
    s=((a+b+c+d+e)*100)/500;
    if(s>=60)
        printf("1st division");
    else if(s>=50&&s<=59)
        printf("2nd division");
    else if(s>=40&&s<=49)
        printf("3rd division");
    else if(s<40)
        printf("fail");
    else
        printf("not related");
}
```
### Output
```
Enter the number of 5 different subjects of a student-
80
65
34
44
78
1st division
```
