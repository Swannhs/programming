## C Implementation
### 22. Write a C program An automobile company has serial number for engine parts starting from AA0 to FF9. The other characteristics of parts to be specified in a structure are: Year of manufacture, material and quantity manufactured. Specify a structure to store information corresponding to a part. Write a program to retrieve information on parts with serial numbers between BB1 and CC6.

        gets(p[i].sl);
        printf("Enter yr of manufactur , material and qtty\n");
        scanf("%d%s%d",&p[i].yr,&p[i].material,&p[i].qty);

### Output
```
Enter sl no
