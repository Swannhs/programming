## C Implementation
### Program-20: Write a program in C that takes minutes as input, and display the total number of hours and minutes.
```c
/*Write a program in C that takes minutes as input, and display the total number of hours and minutes.*/
#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
    int a,b,c;
    scanf("%d",&a);
    b=a/60;
    c=a%60;
    printf("Total Hour=%d \n Total minute=%d",b,c);
}
```
### Output
```
200
Total Hour::=3
Total Minute::=20
```

## C++ Implementation
### Program-20: Write a program in C++ that takes minutes as input, and display the total number of hours and minutes.
```c
/*Write a program in C++ that takes minutes as input, and display the total number of hours and minutes.*/
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int a,b,c;
    cin>>a;
    b=a/60;
    c=a%60;
    cout<<"Total Hour:"<<b<<endl;
    cout<<"Total Minute:"<<c;
    return 0;
}
```
### Output
```
200
Total Hour::=3
Total Minute::=20
```

## Java Implementation
### Program-20: Write a program in java that takes minutes as input, and display the total number of hours and minutes.
```js
/*Write a program in java that takes minutes as input, and display the total number of hours and minutes.*/
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Funycode {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        int a,b,c;
        Scanner z=new Scanner(System.in);
        a=z.nextInt();
        b=a/60;
        c=a%60;
        System.out.println("Total Hour::="+b);
        System.out.println("Total Minute::="+c);

    }
}
}
```
### Output
```
200
Total Hour::=3
Total Minute::=20
```
