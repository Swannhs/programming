## C Implementation
### Program-21: If the marks obtained by a student in five different subjects are input through the keyboard. Write a C program find out the aggregate marks and percentage marks obtained by the student. Assume that the maximum marks that can be obtained by a student in each subject is 100.
```c
/*If the marks obtained by a student in five different subjects are input through the keyboard. Write a C program find out find out the aggregate marks and percentage marks obtained by the student. Assume that the maximum marks that can be obtained by a student in each subject is 100.*/
#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
    int a,b,c,d,e,h;
    float f,g;
    scanf("%d%d%d%d%d",&a,&b,&c,&d,&e);
    h=a+b+c+d+e;
    f=h/5;
    printf("Aggerate Mark=%f\n",f);
    g=(h*100)/500;
    printf("Percentage=%f\n",g);
    if(a>b&&a>c&&a>d&&a>e)
        printf("Maximum=%d",a);
    if(b>a&&b>c&&b>d&&b>e)
        printf("Maximum=%d",b);
    if(c>b&&c>a&&c>d&&c>e)
        printf("Maximum=%d",c);
    if(d>b&&d>c&&d>a&&d>e)
        printf("Maximum=%d",d);
    if(e>b&&e>c&&e>d&&e>a)
        printf("Maximum=%d",e);
}
```
### Output
```

33
66
55
Aggerate Mark=44.0
Percentage:=44.0
Maximum:=66
```
